# Download All Images Feature Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Canvas Selection Problem
**Problem**: The original code was looking for `canvas` elements directly under `.result-item`, but the canvas elements were nested deeper in the DOM structure.

**Fix**: Changed the selector logic to:
- First get all `.result-item` elements
- Then find canvas elements within each result item using `querySelector("canvas")`
- Added proper validation to ensure canvases exist before processing

### 2. Improved Filename Formatting
**Problem**: Filenames were very basic (e.g., `section-1.png`) and not descriptive.

**Fix**: Implemented a sophisticated filename generation system:
- Extract heading text from section names
- Clean up special characters and format properly
- Use format: `01-heading-name-to-next-heading-name.png`
- Add timestamp to ZIP filename: `markdown-cropper-export-20240101T120000.zip`
- Limit filename lengths to prevent filesystem issues
- Handle edge cases with fallback naming

### 3. Better Error Handling
**Problem**: Limited error feedback and no progress indication.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling:
- Check for canvas availability before processing
- Validate blob creation
- Proper error messages with `.catch()` blocks
- Progress indicators and user feedback

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
**Improvements Made**:
- Disable download button during processing
- Show progress text ("Preparing download...", "Creating ZIP file...")
- Success confirmation with count of downloaded images
- Prevent multiple simultaneous downloads
- Added CSS styles for disabled button state

### 5. Individual Download Improvements
**Fix**: Also improved individual image download filenames to be consistent:
- Format: `heading-name-to-next-heading-timestamp.png`
- Same cleaning and formatting logic as batch downloads
- Added timestamps to prevent filename conflicts

## Technical Details

### Key Changes in `downloadAllImages()` function:
1. **Canvas Discovery**: `document.querySelectorAll(".result-item")` â†’ find canvas within each
2. **Filename Generation**: Parse section names and create descriptive filenames
3. **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback throughout the process
4. **Error Recovery**: Proper cleanup and user notification

### Filename Cleaning Logic:
- Remove "Section X:" prefixes
- Convert to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters except word chars, spaces, hyphens
- Limit length to prevent issues
- Handle multiple consecutive hyphens

### Example Filename Formats:
- **Before**: `section-1.png`, `section-2.png`
- **After**: `01-introduction-to-getting-started.png`, `02-main-content-to-conclusion.png`
- **ZIP**: `markdown-cropper-export-20240315T143022.zip`
