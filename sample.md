# Markdown Cropper Sample

This is a sample markdown file to demonstrate the Markdown Cropper tool.

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.

### Key Features

- Simple syntax
- Easy to read and write
- Can be converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats

## How to Use This Tool

The Markdown Cropper tool allows you to:

1. Upload or paste markdown content
2. View the rendered markdown
3. Set crop points at different headings
4. Add a watermark to the output
5. Export sections as PNG images

### Setting Crop Points

You can set crop points at any heading in your document. This allows you to divide your document into sections for export.

## Examples

Here's an example of a code block:

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

And here's an example of a table:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Markdown | A lightweight markup language |
| HTML | HyperText Markup Language |
| CSS | Cascading Style Sheets |
